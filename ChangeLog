Release 0.5.2: 14/11/2005
=========================

- add meaningful "not selected" messages to the various lists

- On 64-bit systems, perl warns that converting hex->dec for a value
greater than 2^32 is non-portable. Provide an env var
EXMAP_HIDE_HEX_WARN to allow this to be suppressed. What is the 'right
thing' to do here?

- some performance work. Startup/shutdown down to approx 13.3s from
24s on my system.

- keep truncate command line to first one or two args (including the
second only if it begins with a [), to give better KDE behaviour) to
avoid long cmdline messing UI.

- Some website work, including FAQ.
	
Release 0.5.1: 4/11/2005
========================

Update following 0.5 feedback:

- pre-sort lists by effective size (descending)

- add 'cmdline' column for KDE (the have kdeinit as the exe for all procs)

- don't strip out [vdso], it seems to cause problems on Fedora and amd64

- fix -Wall errors for userland .c files	
	
Release 0.5: 4/11/2005
======================

Significant rewrite. Rather than expose the VMAs within a process in
the 'Process' API, an intermediate layer of 'maps' is used. This was
done to provide an interface with better than page granularity for
examining ranges (needed for examining ELF sections and symbols
easily).

Added (seems to be working) list of ELF sections and symbols. If the
file you are examining is an ELF file, you'll see the different ELF
sections listed.  If the file is an *unstripped* ELF file, you can
also select an ELF section and examine the ELF symbols (functions,
global data) within that section.

ELF symbols are now listed to byte granularity.
