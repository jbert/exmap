Which of these would be most useful?

- show mapped files for selected process

- add 'view usage info for a shared lib in a single process'

- For ELF files, collate the multiple VMAs for a single elf files into
one, correctly accounting for .text, .data and .bss (if present).

- Find a way to identify glibc [anon] maps as heap

- Provide per-symbol usage for unstripped ELF files

- more and better tests

BUGS
====

- "PID 9968 can't find VMA afd37000 at Exmap.pm line 297."

Occassional failure, at startup, probably due to a process doing work
after we save a snapshot of its maps. Let me know if this happens
frequently enough to be annoying.
