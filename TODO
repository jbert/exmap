- try and show thread stack usage
	- maybe additional info from kernel module?

- support earlier kernel versions (no pud_t. See mail from Joaquim)

- is there a way to avoid the sysread/seek for each string name in ELF?
	- maybe read the string table in chunks?
		- or cache 1 page

- we can have a map to a (deleted) file. We'll fail to open this
(d'uh). What problem does this cause? Just a "non elf" file?

DONE - update Makefile with 'normal CFLAGS'. Perhaps -fPIC for all?	

- read /proc/k?mem using pfn to show hex contents?
	- I think /dev/mem is what is wanted.
	- shift pfn to get a physical address
	- seek & read /dev/mem to read data

	- add a 'RangeView' to exmap.pl
		- pfns are in Vma, so add 'read_mem_range' to that?

Which of these would be most useful?

- Find a way to identify glibc [anon] maps as heap

- Elf.pm is holding an open fd to each Elf file. We probably need it
to seek to read symbols, unless we open/close there (or make it
private and do it in the caller).

- if we do 'reload', functionality then will need to explicitly break
proc <-> file <-> vma links since refcounting won't.
