- two digit accuracy on kbyte

DONE - sort by effective size
	- reorder to effective first?

DONE - -Wall -Werror

DONE - Most KDE processes are shown as /opt/kde3/bin/kdeinit here, because
of the kdeinit hack. However with recent kernel versions top shows
them as e.g. kwrite instead of kdeinit. I'm not quite sure how that's
done though.

DONE - The UI tool could either default to downwards sorting by effective
memory or even better save the sorting. I always have to double-click
the column in all views to have them sorted in the IMHO best way.

- update Makefile with 'normal CFLAGS'. Perhaps -fPIC for all?	

- command line tool (to help reduce mem foorprint)

- build a gnome2 and look for mem hogs :-)

DONE? - have autotest cover .bss being split over two vmas.

- read /proc/k?mem using pfn to show hex contents?
	- I think /dev/mem is what is wanted.
	- shift pfn to get a physical address
	- seek & read /dev/mem to read data

	- add a 'RangeView' to exmap.pl
		- pfns are in Vma, so add 'read_mem_range' to that?

Which of these would be most useful?

DONE - show overall Effective. This should add up to total mem in use...

- Find a way to identify glibc [anon] maps as heap

DONE - Provide per-symbol usage for unstripped ELF files

- better documentation (tooltips?) to explain numbers

- Elf.pm is holding an open fd to each Elf file. We probably need it
to seek to read symbols, unless we open/close there (or make it
private and do it in the caller).

- if we do 'reload', functionality then will need to explicitly break
proc <-> file <-> vma links since refcounting won't.

BUGS
====

- "PID 9968 can't find VMA afd37000 at Exmap.pm line 297."

Occassional failure, at startup, probably due to a process doing work
after we save a snapshot of its maps. Let me know if this happens
frequently enough to be annoying.

[update: we now read the exmap info sooner after reading the
/proc/xxx/map info. This reduces (but doesn't eliminate) the window to
cause this problem.]


- Can't open mapfile /proc/18301/maps: No such file or directory at
Exmap.pm line 224.

Benign. Due to process exit after snapshot?


- 'undefined val for mapped_size...'

[not seen since reading exmap info straight after /proc/xxx/maps]
